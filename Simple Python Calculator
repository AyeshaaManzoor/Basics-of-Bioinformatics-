# Python Calculator Program 
Design and implement a basic calculator program in Python that can perform the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Your calculator should take input from the user for two numbers and the desired operation, and then display the result.

# Follow the following steps:
1- The calculator should handle basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2- The program should prompt the user to input two numbers and the operation they want to perform.
3- Division by zero should be handled gracefully with an appropriate error message.
4- Use comments in your code to explain the logic of each section
5- Test your calculator with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.
